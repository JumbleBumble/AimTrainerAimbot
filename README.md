# AimTrainerAimbot
Simple Aim Trainer Aimbot application tool made with PyQt5, AutoAimTrainer and RegionFetch. Capture regions, pick colors &amp; automatically click targets. Made specifically for 2D Aim Trainer Games but could be used for more than just that.

## Setup

- Install Python 3.6+
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt

## How To Use

- Select a color from the target
- Select a region
- Set any offsets you'll need
- Start the aimbot, if you get mouse locked then you can always shove it into any corner of your screen to trigger a pyautogui failsafe which will automatically stop the aimbot.
